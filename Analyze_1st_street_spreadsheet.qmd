##    First Street Data

Using a non-commercial account (because the price for a commercial account is
really high), I found the nearest residence to each of 164 churches in the
diocese, and ran reports on those locations. For a couple of spots, where the
distance was large, I used flood maps to get better data. I then captured by
hand a few key indicators from the reports and entered them into a spreadsheet.
The purpose of this mini-project is to analyze and summarize that data in a
meaningful form.

```{r}
#   setup

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

Local_path <- "/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/TexasDioceseCreationCare/Data/"
output_path <- "/home/ajackson/Dropbox/projects/CeationCareTaskforce/FirstStreet/"

Parishes <- readRDS(paste0(path, "Parishes.rds"))

```

##        Read in the spreadsheet 

Read the spreadsheet in and do a little cleanup and error-checking

```{r}

df <- readxl::read_xls(paste0(output_path, "Churches.xls"))

#   Let's break up some columns, and delete some.

df <- df %>% 
  select(-c(8:10)) %>% # drop Air, Heat, and address used
  rename(Flood=5, Fire=6, Wind=7, Flood50=9, Wind50=10, FloodMax=11) %>% 
  mutate(Flood50=stringr::str_replace(Flood50, "6 in", "0.5 ft")) %>% 
  mutate(FloodMax=stringr::str_replace(FloodMax, "6 in", "0.5 ft")) %>% 
  mutate(Flood50=as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(Flood50, "\\s[0-9\\.]+\\s"))) %>% 
  mutate(Wind50=as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(Wind50, "\\s[0-9\\.]+\\s"))) %>% 
  mutate(FloodMax=as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(FloodMax, "\\s[0-9\\.]+\\s")))
  
```

##        Let's make some flood plots

```{r}

#   Number of 6 inch floods

df %>% 
  filter(Flood>0) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Flood)) +
    geom_histogram() +
    labs(title="Churches expected to see 6 inches of flooding over 30 years",
         caption="Data from First Street Foundation reports",
         x="Percent Probability of 6 inches of flooding in 30 years",
         y="Number of churches")

#   Max floods

df %>% 
  filter(FloodMax>0) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=FloodMax)) +
    geom_histogram() +
    labs(title="Maximum Expected Flood Depth Over 30 Years",
         caption="Data from First Street Foundation reports",
         x="Flood Depth in Feet",
         y="Number of churches")

#   Depths of flood at 50% probability

df %>% 
  filter(Flood50>0) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Flood50)) +
    geom_histogram() +
    labs(title="50% Probability Flood Depth Over 30 Years",
         caption="Data from First Street Foundation reports",
         x="Flood Depth in Feet",
         y="Number of churches")
  
  
```

##        Now let's make some fire plots

```{r}

df %>% 
  filter(Fire>0) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Fire)) +
    geom_histogram() +
    labs(title="Probability of Wildfire over 30 Years",
         caption="Data from First Street Foundation reports",
         x="Percent probability",
         y="Number of churches")

```

##        Wind plots

```{r}

df %>% 
  filter(stringr::str_detect(Notes, "\\*", negate=TRUE)|is.na(Notes)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Wind)) +
    geom_histogram() +
    labs(title="Probability of Tropical Winds of 100 mph over 30 Years",
         caption="Data from First Street Foundation reports",
         x="Percent probability",
         y="Number of churches")

```
