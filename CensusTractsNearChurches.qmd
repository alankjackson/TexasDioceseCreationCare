##  Find the census tracts near the churches

Create a data frame with census tracts that each church lives in, plus a list of tracts within
a 1 mile radius

```{r setup}

library(tidyverse)

googlecrs <- "EPSG:4326"
localUTM <- "EPSG:32615"

path <- "/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/TexasDioceseCreationCare/Data/"

Parishes <- readRDS(paste0(path, "Parishes.rds"))

```
