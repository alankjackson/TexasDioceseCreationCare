## Calculate probabilities of getting hit by a derecho

```{r}

#   Average size of derecho
length <- 325 # miles
width <-  60 # miles
Derecho_area <- length*width*2.58999 # km^2

#   2 derechos per year occur in an area of 1.2e6 km^2
Two_derech <- 1.2e6
#   ! derecho per year occurs in an area of 2.7e6 km^2 minus overlap
One_derech <- 2.7e6 - Two_derech

#   Probability of being hit in a given year is just the fraction of the area

P_two <- Derecho_area/Two_derech 
P_one <- Derecho_area/(One_derech*2) #    The 2 is because there is one every 2 years

#   Probability over 30 years is 1-prob of one year^30
P_two_30 <- 1 - P_two**30
P_one_30 <- 1 - P_one**30

#   From calculator for return period https://www.weather.gov/epz/wxcalc_floodperiod
#   Return period for area 2 is 12 years
#   Return period for area 1 is 29 years


```
