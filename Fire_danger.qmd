## match parishes to Fire Danger

Using the spreadsheet from
https://headwaterseconomics.org/natural-hazards/wildfire/more-than-1100-communities-urban-wildfire-risk/

match up by city so I can seee their estimates of fire danger by parish

```{r setup}

library(tidyverse)
library(sf)

path <- "/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/TexasDioceseCreationCare/Data/"
output_path <- "/home/ajackson/Dropbox/projects/CeationCareTaskforce/FirstStreetFlood/"
Curated_path <- "/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Curated_Data_Files/Texas_Counties/"
Fire_path <- "/home/ajackson/Dropbox/projects/Creation_Care_and_Sustainable/Data/"


#   Some useful data

Convocations <- readRDS(paste0(path, "Convocation_and_tracts.rds"))
Parishes <- readRDS(paste0(path, "Parishes_plus_Census_tracts.rds"))
Counties <- readRDS(paste0(Curated_path, "County_Outlines.rds"))

```

##    Read in spreadsheet and clean up

```{r}

sheets <- readxl::excel_sheets(paste0(Fire_path, "Fire_risk_wrc_download_202505.xlsx"))

#   Read in fifth sheet (that is where cities live)

df <- sheets[5] %>% 
  set_names() %>% 
  map_df(~ readxl::read_excel(path = paste0(Fire_path, "Fire_risk_wrc_download_202505.xlsx"), 
                      sheet = .x, 
                      skip=0), 
         .id = "sheet")



#   Pull out Texas only, and strip the ", TX" from the city name field

df <- df %>% 
  filter(STUSPS=="TX") %>% 
  mutate(NAME=stringr::str_remove(NAME, ", TX"))

```

##    Join spreadsheet to parishes

```{r}

```
