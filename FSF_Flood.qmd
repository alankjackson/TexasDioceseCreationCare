##        Read in and analyze the First Street Foundation flood data

Data acquired from FSF through a request on an AWS server
After access granted, copied to a bucket on my AWS account
Then downloaded (one at a time) the files to my PC


```{r setup}

library(tidyverse)

path <- "/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/TexasDioceseCreationCare/Data/FSF_Flood/"

```

##        Read the data in by census tract and filter out diocese

```{r}

```
